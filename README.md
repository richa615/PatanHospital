PatanHospital
=============

This is a project developed by students of Loyola University Chicago for Open Source Computing(COMP 412). We gratefully acknowledge professor Matthew Butcher(github technosophos) for his support to build this project.

This is an application developed primarily to make interaction in the hospital environment easier. There are primarily 3 end users, Administrator, Doctor and a patient. It creates a bridge among all the end users makinginteraction among each other easier. PatanHospital works as a basic structure that can be applied to any hospital environment and can be easily customized.

The project is developed in Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2012. The backend server used is MS Server 2008. The server is hosted on sql.cs.luc.edu.

The later versions will have the following features: Administrator can delete patient/doctor information, reserve appointments for patients over the phone, edit the reservations, patients can reserve appointment themselves, email notification upon reserving an appointment, any edit on the reservation and deletion of the reservation.
