=============

This is a project developed by students of Loyola University Chicago for Open Source Computing(COMP 412). We gratefully acknowledge professor Matthew Butcher(github technosophos) for his support to build this project.

This is an application developed primarily to make interaction in the hospital environment easier. There are primarily 3 end users Administrator, Doctor and a patient. It creates a bridge among all the end users making interaction among each other easier. PatanHospital works as a basic structure that can be applied to any hospital environment and can be easily customized to meet specific requirement.

The project is developed in Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2012. The backend server used is MS Server 2008. The server is hosted on sql.cs.luc.edu.

The latest versionof the project has the following features: Administrator can register,edit and delete patient/doctor information, reserve appointments for patients over the phone, edit the reservations.Patients can register themselves and reserve appointment with a doctor, request reservation over the phone and edit their information. Doctors can view their profile and view the appointment scheduled for a specific day. An auto generated password is mailed to doctor and patient upon registration. An email is also sent to doctors and patients upon appointment reservation. Forgot password and update password feature is also available for the doctor and patient.
